**About Us:** <br>
The <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color); font-weight: 500">ENCODE Lab</span> (**E**fficient **N**eural network **CO**mputation and **DE**sign) is led by Dr. [Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/), a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/huan-wang.html). We focus on building efficient and reliable AI systems that are scalable and self-improving, driving both theoretical innovation and practical impact.

**Research Focus:** <br>
Our research centers on **Efficient AI**, spanning multiple domains in vision and language:
- **LLMs/MLLMs**: [[DyCoke](https://github.com/KD-TAO/DyCoke), [HoliTom](https://github.com/cokeshao/HoliTom), [OmniZip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14582), [MergeMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23479), [StreamingTOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269), [RLKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525), [VidKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16257), [ResSVD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20112), [SparseSSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09613), [VAP](https://kejiazhang-robust.github.io/poison-cure-lvm/), [ReasonMap](https://fscdc.github.io/Reason-Map/), [RewardMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240), [Survey](https://github.com/cokeshao/Awesome-Multimodal-Token-Compression)]
- **Image Generation** (diffusion/AR models): [[OBS-Diff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06751), [VideoPruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375), [ARPG](https://hp-l33.github.io/projects/arpg), [FreqExit](https://neuraliying.github.io/FreqExit/)]
- **3D Reconstruction**: [[Niagara](https://ai-kunkun.github.io/Niagara_page/)]
- **Snapshot Compressive Imaging**: [[QuantizedSCI](https://github.com/mcao92/QuantizedSCI), [MobileSCI](https://github.com/mcao92/MobileSCI)]

**Join Us:** <br>
Our lab is actively recruiting **Ph.D. students** (2026 Fall, 1 position), **Research Assistants** (1 position), and **Visiting Students** to work on Efficient AI (e.g., pruning, quantization, distillation), GenAI (e.g., diffusion models, LLM/MLLM), 3D (e.g., NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), low-level vision (e.g., image restoration), etc. We foster a professional, equal, chill, and creative environment with competitive compensation, sufficient computing resources (H800/A100/A800/A6000/4090), and opportunities for academic collaboration and industry internships.
