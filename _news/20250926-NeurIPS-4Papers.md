`[NeurIPS'25]` **Four papers** accepted to NeurIPS 2025 in the field of efficient and reliable AI. Congrats to our students and collaborators! Two papers from our lab:

- **HoliTom**: A top-performing video LLM token compression method that maintains 99.1% performance while reducing FLOPs to just 6.9%—and it's training-free!
